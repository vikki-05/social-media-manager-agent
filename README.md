# Social Media Manager Agent 🤖

An autonomous, agentic AI system that analyzes historical social media engagement data and generates optimized content captions and posting strategies.

This project demonstrates how an AI agent can **observe**, **analyze**, **decide**, and **act** without human intervention.

## 🧠 Agent Architecture

The agent follows a classic **Agent Loop**:

### 1. Observe
Reads historical social media data (`posts.csv`).

### 2. Analyze
Calculates engagement metrics (likes + comments + shares).

### 3. Decide
Selects:
- Best performing content type
- Best posting time based on past engagement

### 4. Act
Uses an AI model (via ScaleDown) to generate an optimized caption.

### 5. Explain
Outputs reasoning behind its decisions for transparency.
